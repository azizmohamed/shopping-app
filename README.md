# Shopping App
This repo is for a shopping cart sample application. Main purpose is to demonstrate end to end application. 

## Frontend
Front end is built using React and Typescript. 
Redux toolkit and redux toolkit query are used for state management and http requests.

## Backend
Backend is built using asp.net. 

## Testing
A sample unit test is added to Backend but tests added to Frontend are not enough.

## Future enhancements
- More unit and integrations tests to be added to the solution.
- A bug related to shipping calculations to be fixed. User should change quantity or delete product for the shipping and amount calculations to reflect in UI.
